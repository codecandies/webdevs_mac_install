# Automatic installation routine for webdevelopment on mac computers

Always when you install a new computer, or jump start with a clean install, you have to

- somehow remember, what programs you always install (you might easy remember the big things, but what was this small tool named you use for color picking)
- install all programs as they are needed, or in one long seesion (until you'll remember something else the next day)
- configure all these programs for your need

â€¦ at least these are my problems almost always. With tools like [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and especially [homebrew bundler](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) we can automate the first two points on this list. So I've ~~wrote~~ copy & pasted some shell scripting fu and made a `Brewfile` of the tools I think, a webdeveloper needs, when he is starting with a new mac. Feel free to fork, copy and paste this stuff, complete or just the `Brewfile`. to get a quick start on your computer.

## Usage
Copy the `Brewfile.example` file into you home directory and if needed add more programs. If you put your compiled programs anywhere other than `/Applications`, edit the `cask_args appdir: '/Applications'` line accordingly.

In the end, there is not much more to do then copying `install_my_mac.sh` in you home directory of your new mac, open the terminal and start it with `./install_my_mac.sh` and wait some time. From time to time you my need to push *the any key* but overall, everything should work automatically.

You are done then and have more time to configure your freshly installed mac.
